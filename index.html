    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Samoina is a budding software developer whose interest in the world of tech was something that bubled under the surface. Her foray into software development began a couple of years ago. After learning that she had suffered postpartum depression after her son's birth, Samoina wanted to make sure that as many mothers as possible knew about this mental health condition. She then began sharing her journey on the free Wordpress blog, adding candin and often raw accounts of her motherhood experience. Getting to write these blogs had her wondering what really happened on the back-end.<br> Enter McBooll, her brother-in-law and a self-taught developer. His commitment to learning and becoming a better software developer was the spark that ignited Samoina's interest in software development. A seemingly synchronous chain of events saw her awarded a scholarship to study at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a> here in Nairobi.Additionally, as a Postpartum Depression survivor, Samoina continues to create awareness through the <a href="http://ppdkenya.com/">non-profit</a> she founded. She is also a fitness enthusiast and has maintained a workout routine for the past two years. She regularly shares her progress on her Instagram account.</p>
    <h3>Why Moringa School?</h3>
    <p>Moringa takes pride in helping people kick-start their career in tech by:
      <ol>
        <li>Providing market-driven programs</li>
        <li>Creating a comprehensive learning system that includes lots of practical projects</li>
        <li>Including a Graduate Support Program to provide alumni with tools for future success in the tech industry</li>
      </ol>
      I wanted to be a part of this eco-system, so when a friend sent a tweet that Moringa was offering scholarships, I applied immediately. The online interview process was very straightforward, and that is how I am now undertaking the Prep Course for software development! :)
